	This subculture consists of the idea of music, concerts, and harry styles. There is often a large fanbase that is created through popular artists as well as the subculture of "concerts" that I really enjoy. This can also go into the expectation that comes from attending music festivals. This idea of music interests me quite a bit, particularly in the category of specific artists. I especially thought that perhaps analyzing the global phenomenon that is Harry Styles would be interesting. To me personally, his "One Direction" debut is drastically different than his solo artist career, researching this and the effect of his fanbase would be an interesting topic. I could also maybe touch on what was so restrictive with his previous career.
