	How Spotify’s Discover Weekly works Spotify’s Discover Weekly recommendation model isn’t a revolutionary one. Instead, it’s a combination of a number of effective recommendation techniques previously used by other industry players. This has led to a uniquely powerful music recommendation engine, mainly based on three recommendation models: Collaborative filtering consists of collecting and analysing users’ behaviours; Content-based filtering looks at the descriptions of songs and artists; Audio features are extracted from the raw audio through machine learning.
