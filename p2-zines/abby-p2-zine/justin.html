	<h1 class="justinpar">The world around us is constantly being documented by orbiting satellites. They are capturing images of the Earth for us to observe, document, and analyze. Many use this data to study the Earth, humans, and competition. However, when you remove all of that context about data analysis and the tool that is being used to capture the image, you are left with a beautiful work of art. The surface of the Earth is essentially a giant canvas. If you zoom into any part of the world, you will find entirely unique textures and forms. These can be made by natural landforms as well as human infrastructure. If you look at images that have been taken using different wavelengths of light, they would look otherworldly, yet it is our world. I would like to create a site that cherishes this abstract perspective on satellite imagery and the art that it captures. </h1>
