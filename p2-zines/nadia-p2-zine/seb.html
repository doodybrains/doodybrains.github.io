WHAT IS BACKYARD FARMING?
</h1>

<h3 style="color: white">
Backyard farming—also referred to as “urban farming” or “urban homesteading”—is a way for those who live in more populated cities and neighborhoods to transform part of their property into a small farm or “microfarm” as a way to grow and produce their own food.

				The term “backyard farming” is sometimes used to make a distinction between traditional gardening (where you might plant tomatoes or peppers in the same area of your yard each year and hope for the best) and a more deliberate and planned approach to growing your own food.

			<span class="slide-in">
				However, the term “farming” as it is being used here is not to imply that you need to grow things on a larger scale or produce crops to sell to the public. Backyard farming uses a concept known as “permaculture,” which is a system of designing an organic garden that works alongside nature to encourage the growth of fruits, vegetables, and flowers.
