	<span class="p1">This subculture consists of those who are so addicted to the adrenaline that they become adrenaline junkies. I'm potentially interested in the psychology behind it as well as researching exactly what these people do as I have only really heard of things such as extreme rock climbing, climbing Mount Everest, etc. It also makes me think of what kind of fulfillment these people get out of their lives when they're able to talk about the crazy things that they have done.
