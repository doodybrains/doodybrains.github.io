		Overlanding
	</h1>

<span class="pp1">Overlanding is self-reliant overland travel to remote destinations where <br><span class="journey">the journey is the principal goal.</span><br><br> Typically, but not exclusively, it is accomplished with mechanized off-road-capable transport (from bicycles to trucks) where the principal form of lodging is camping, often lasting for extended lengths of time (months to years) and spanning international boundaries. It was introduced on other continents decades before bursting onto the scene in America and dates back to the early 1900s when Australia began to establish routes for long-distance travel within the continent. It would be interesting to combine this outdoor adventure with the aesthetics of maps and signage of national parks. It could perhaps serve as a visual guide for the activity and the destinations it can lead to.
