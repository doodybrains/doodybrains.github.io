        <p>"Tur". A Norwegian word that is defined as a trip and is a culturally significant to the importance of outdoor experience among Norwegians. The importance of this word has lead me to research further into how integrated nature and its importance is engrained into Norwegian culture in so many different forms and facets of life. The most common first date is a hike, they are one of the leading countries in renewable energy.
